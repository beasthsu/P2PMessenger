P2PMessenger is a peer-to-peer chating software which includes multi-media streaming features. The structure of peers is ring-based network. A server is implemented for tracking the liveness of peers.

This project is unmaintained since the first version was come out in June, 2011.

System requirement for development:
-------------------------------

	1. JDK7 32-bit version(since only 32-bit JMF package is available, one should install 32-bit JDK to link this API),
	2. JAVA Media Framework API(also known as JMF)

Build
-------------------------------

	Environment variable require: 
	JAVA_HOME
	JMF_HOME

	The JAVA_HOME variable is require to locate your jdk home path.(ex: If you install jdk 1.7.0_79 under "/home/USER1", then the JAVA_HOME should be "/home/USER1/jdk1.7.0_79")
	The JMF_HOME is the installation path of the JMF framework. If the JMF classes have been added to the CLASSPATH environment path by the official installer, then JMF_HOME can be ignored.

	To building the peer program:
	make PeerUI

	To building the server program:
	make MultiChatServer

	or building the both:
	make
	make all

	Clean all class file:
	make clean
